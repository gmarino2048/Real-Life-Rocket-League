# SocCar Project

## Hardware

There are two important components of the hardware for this project: the arena and the car. The arena will display the players' usernames and scores, and will relay that information back to the server. The car will listen for input from the server, and will move accordingly so that the player is able to control the car to get the ball into the goal.
