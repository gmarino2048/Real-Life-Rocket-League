# Code Coverage Estimate

## Arduino Code Test Coverage: 87%

The method by which this coverage was estimated was by taking the individual functions that were going to be tested and counting the number of lines in each file to be ported to the test files. The total number of lines in the functions to be tested were then divided by the total number of functional lines in the entire project.

The functional tests of the Arduino Code are currently incomplete, and there is no code coverage software to aid in the testing process, so I have had to do all of the code coverage estimations by hand. Given this, I expect the code coverage estimate to be accurate in this case. The actual coverage should be within 5% of the actual value.
