TEST RESULTS

The API Connection Test hits approximately 85 - 90% of our source code.
However, this depends heavily on the manual user input, so below I will
cover how to achieve maximal code coverage on a single run:

1. Start the APIConnectionTest Class

2. Enter the correct information. See ID and Secret.txt

3. Be sure to answer "no" when prompted at least once for each field

4. When prompted for the cipher key, be sure to remember which one you 
used!!! Default value is "Password"

5. Wait one minute

6. When prompted for a new cipher key, enter a bad one at least once
before entering the correct value. This should be the same one used
in step 4

7. View results!

The above method should give 60% code coverage overall, with 85% coverage
on the authenticator, 70% coverage on the OAuthFileManager, and 88% coverage
on the APIConnection.

It was deemed too inefficient to attempt to generate another test case for the
Authenticator, as the few methods which could be tested involved encryption and
decryption, each of which are fully covered by using the example above. Besides,
if anything goes wrong in the encryption and decryption process

Since the OAuth File manager did not have excellent coverage using the 
APIConnectionTest class, a second test suite was designed to be run against
the OAuthFileManager. These tests get a coverage of about 93% on the 
OAuthFileManager.


All tests report PASS.
